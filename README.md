# About

This is to help teach others how to use the flowed layout mixin. The properties aren't
well documented and can be hard to understand without a visual aide. This is meant to
help make the mixin more understandable and easier to use.

# Sproutcore

I am working off of a 1.9.0 build of SproutCore. The mixin does not change frequently, but
I cannot guarantee your version will run the application perfectly.
